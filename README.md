**Here's an official notice to announce your "Back to Track" series on LinkedIn:**

**Subject: Back to Track: Rekindling My Web Development Journey!**

Hi everyone,

After a brief hiatus due to personal commitments and academic pursuits, I'm thrilled to announce my return to the world of web development! 

To keep myself motivated and accountable, I'll be starting a new series on LinkedIn titled "Back to Track," where I'll share my daily progress and learnings. 

I've also created a to-do list for myself to stay organized. This list will feature:

* **Task Completion:** Tasks can be marked as "Done," striking them through and displaying them in a subtle gray color. The "Done" button will then transform into an "Undo" button for flexibility.
* **Task Deletion:** The "Delete" button will remove the task completely from the list.
* **Time Tracking:** Each task will be timestamped with the time it was added to the list.

I'm excited to embark on this new phase of my learning journey and share my progress with you all. Stay tuned for regular updates!

**Feel free to customize this message further:**

* **Add a personal touch:** Include a brief anecdote about what motivated you to return to web development.
* **Mention specific goals:** Briefly mention your short-term or long-term goals in web development.
* **Invite interaction:** Encourage your connections to ask questions, offer suggestions, or share their own learning experiences.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like to brainstorm further on the content of your "Back to Track" series.
